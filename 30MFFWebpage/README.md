#### Description:
- The Webpage is based on a fictional video where a stuffed toy is being interviewed by a human.
- The stuffed toy is known as Mr. Bear.
- The Webpage starts with a tagline where Mr. Bear welcomes the viewer to the Webpage.
- The theme of the Website is set to be cute, heart-warming, and low key, where a user comes to feel happy and laugh.

#### Process: 
- First of all was the colour scheme. Even though I had decided on a color scheme in my wireframe, when I came about making my website, I was not satisfied and that's why I had to do a lot of trial and error to choose a color scheme that represents my website.
- The color scheme I chose was brownish since it gives a very happy and wholesome/cute vibe, and it also resonates with the interview since it's Mr. Bear's favourite color.
- Then I created a header and chose a logo for it (to look cute).
- Then I wrote the tagline, where I also added an emoji.
- Then the section divides into to parts: The interview and the Bloopers.
- I formatted them in a way where they can be distinguishable.
- Then I added some description and the members of the team who actually made the video.
- The page ends with a footer.

#### Reflection:
- It was extremely hard to format the content, to place things exactly where we want them to be was a huge hassle.
- Trying to make the webpage visually appealing by css was a bit tricky as well.
- Trying to make sure everything is as perfect as we want them to be.
- Integrating JavaScript with HTML was also harder than I thought it would be.
- I learnt how to debug using the Inspect function of a browser.
- However, at last, I achieved most of my goals, by trying, debugging, and learning.
- I will still get better with practice, that's what I feel like.
